# Real-Time Traffic Analyzer

Real-time Traffic Analyzer is considered a fork implementation of the Robocar World Championship. 

Robocar World Championship is intended to offer a common research platform for developing urban traffic control algorithms and for investigating the relationship between smart cities and robot cars with particular attention to spread of robot cars of the near future. At the heart of this initiative is the Robocar City Emulator. It will enable researchers to test and validate their theories and models.

More information about the system and the system plan can be found at https://github.com/nbatfai/robocar-emulator.

The input of the Robocar City emulator consists of the measured and estimated data of road loads. We can measure this data in different ways. Besides the crowd sourcing methods (e.g. with a mobile phone aplication) an automatic way (without the need of human interaction) is plausible. The system discussed below is considered as an automatic measuring system for the input of the Robocar City Emulator.

This project attemps to give a solution for a part of the Robocar World Championship, namely the Automated Sensor Annotations (ASA for short).
